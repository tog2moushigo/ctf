## Details

This is the record that I challenged CTF.
If you have already gotten flags and want to know my ways of solving them, this repository is the best.

If you have gotten flags yet, I don't recommend to see.
Because I'm a beginner and the answer that other people have solved is better than mine.

I mainly leave problems that require programming, so some of them are solved but I do not post the solution.
